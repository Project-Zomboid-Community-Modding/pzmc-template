## This is a Project Zomboid Mod Template
### It is staged for a hybrid B41 and B42 setup.
See: https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Mod_structure for more info.

### Note on Non-standard [images](images/) folder.
This folder is not included in steam-workshop uploads; it is useful for keeping raw images, psd files, larger assets that you may want to keep with your project but obviously don't want players to have to download.

<sup>Note: This is not a standard folder, and can be named anything.</sup>
